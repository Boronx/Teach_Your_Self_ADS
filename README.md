# Teach Your Self Autonomous Driving System
Hi! This is my personal page to record some learning methods and materials about the Autonomous Driving System(ADS) or Automated Vehicles(AV). This page may contain some learning material about specific majors (mainly about CS or AI), some SOTA papers, and also some research tools tutorial like tutorial for VTD, Apollo, etc.  Because of my researching focus, this page may focuses on the field of ADS safety, testing, and evaluation. 
**Key words:** Scenario-based testing, SOTIF, Testing acceleration
